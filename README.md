# Contentful Community Code of Conduct

The **Contentful Community** and the **Code of Conduct** should govern both our [Slack Community](https://contentful.com/slack) and our [Community Forums](https://contentfulcommunity.com).

Going forward we'll be maintaining the Contentful COC via the Contentful Documentation. See it in full at [https://www.contentful.com/developers/code-of-conduct/](https://www.contentful.com/developers/code-of-conduct/)

> Shout out to [@tbarn](https://github.com/tbarn) and [Keen IO](https://github.com/keen/community-code-of-conduct) for creating the original version of this repo.
