## Short Form Code of Conduct
The **Contentful Community** is dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free space and experience for all community participants, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, socioeconomic status, body size, ethnicity, nationality, level of experience, age, religion (or lack thereof), or other identity markers. Our **Code of Conduct** exists because of that dedication, and we do not tolerate harassment in any form. See our reporting guidelines [here](./incident-reporting.md). Our full Code of Conduct can be found at this [link](#long-form-code-of-conduct).

## Long Form Code of Conduct
The **Contentful Community** is dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free space and experience for all community participants, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, socioeconomic status, body size, ethnicity, nationality, level of experience, age, or religion (or lack thereof). Our Code of Conduct exists because of that dedication, and we do not tolerate harassment in any form.

This **Code of Conduct** applies to all **Contentful Community spaces**, including **Contentful open source repositories**, and **Contentful Community events and meetups**, online and offline, as well as in one-on-one communications pertaining to **Contentful Community** business. Participants violating our **Code of Conduct** may be penalized or expelled at the discretion of community moderators.

Some **Contentful Community spaces** may have additional rules in place, which are posted publicly for participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules. We invite all those who participate in the **Contentful Community** to help us create safe and positive community experiences.

Consequences for non-compliance with the **Code of Conduct** may include a discussion with moderators, mediation with the participant you may have harassed, or as an absolute last resort, a ban from the community.

- Remembering that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; being respectful to all patrons of these locations.
- Keeping an open and curious mind without making assumptions about others.
- Attempting collaboration before conflict.
- Gracefully accepting well-communicated constructive criticism.

Harassment includes:

- Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
- Deliberate misgendering or use of “dead” or rejected names.

### Procedures

[Procedures for Incident Reporting](./incident-reporting.md)

### Enforcement
- Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately, even if participants do not agree with or fully acknowledge the behavior being reported.
- If a participant violates the **Code of Conduct**, community moderators may take any action they deem appropriate to maintaining a welcoming environment for all participants, up to and including expulsion from an event and/or the community and identification of the participant as a violator. If a community moderator is not available at an event, the event organizer should ask violators to leave and then report the situation to community moderators for further deliberation.
- There will always be at least one moderator “on-call” if no moderators are able to attend an event
Community moderators and/or event organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting or making an environment hostile for any participants.
- We expect participants to respect the **Code of Conduct** in all **Contentful communities** and at all **Contentful** or **Contentful related events**.

### Moderators
Code of Conduct moderators will:

- Always be at least two people working together to respond to violations.
- Respond as promptly as possible to reports of violations.
- Make an effort to understand both sides of the situation, including talking to affected participants and reading up on the underlying issues, particularly if they don’t have similar personal experience(s).
- Keep each other accountable.
- Trade off duties when needed.
- Recuse themselves or be excused from handling an incident if they are listed as a possible **Code of Conduct** violator.
- Be kept up-to-date in the [Contentful Community Moderators document](./moderators.md).

### Additional Items
Please also note:

- Moderators can choose to close threads or ask for a subject change.
- Moderators can choose to re-evaluate consequences.
- Do not delete posts or comments you’ve made unless:
  - You sincerely made the post in error (like accidentally posting in the wrong group, for example) and
  - Deleting will not interfere with group discussion. The specific problem we want to address with this rule: Deleting because the conversation has become tense or uncomfortable or to avoid taking responsibility is. Many of us are socialized or naturally prone to avoid conflict, but working through that conflict and acknowledging differing viewpoints is worth the discomfort.
- This **Code of Conduct** applies to **Contentful Community** spaces and events, but if you are being or have been harassed by a **Contentful Community participant** externally, you may still report to the **Contentful Community moderators**. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by community participants seriously. The **Contentful Community moderators** reserve the right to exclude people from the **Contentful Community** and/or **Contentful** events based on past and/or external behavior towards **Contentful Community participants** or non-participants.
- We will not name harassment victims without their consent. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of the **Contentful Community** or the general public.

### **Code of Conduct** Feedback
